**Genre:** Epic Orchestral / Film Score \\
**Why it fits:** You've reached the final boss: your thesis. To get through it, you need to feel like a hero. This music gives a serious, emotional feeling to your work, making it seem like finishing each chapter is a huge victory. It helps you believe that even fixing your references is a heroic act, like in a movie. You are the main character, and this is your theme song.\\
**Artist Suggestions:** Hans Zimmer, John Williams, Ramin Djawadi.
