**Genre:** Minimalism \\
**Why it fits:** This playlist is for the cyclical process of drafting, reviewing, and revising papers. Minimalism, with its repetitive phrasing and slowly evolving landscapes, can lock you into the focused, iterative rhythm of writing. It mirrors the act of building a complex argument from simple, repeated elements, helping you meticulously refine your work.\\
**Artist Suggestions:** Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Max Richter.
