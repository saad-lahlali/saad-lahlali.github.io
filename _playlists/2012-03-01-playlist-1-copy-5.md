**Genre:** Minimalism \\
**Why it fits:** Writing a paper means rewriting it over and over. Minimalism totally gets this. Its repeating sounds that slowly change are like fixing the same sentence until it's perfect. The music helps quiet the self-doubt in your head and gets you "in the zone," turning a long, hard job into a moment of calm focus.\\
**Artist Suggestions:** Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Max Richter.
