**Genre:** Jazz Fusion \\
**Why it fits:** Sometimes your brain needs to get a little weird to come up with something new. This music is wild but brilliant, mixing different styles in a way that sounds exciting and unpredictable. It gives you the freedom to try a crazy new idea, because great new things are often found between a wild guitar solo and a cool bassline.\\
**Artist Suggestions:** Mahavishnu Orchestra, Weather Report, Herbie Hancock.
