**Genre:** Jazz Fusion \\
**Why it fits:** This playlist is for the core creative part of your PhD: brainstorming and designing a new algorithm or technique. Jazz Fusion blends complex improvisation with disparate styles, inspiring the "out-of-the-box" thinking required to design a novel method. It perfectly marries raw creativity with rigorous technical skill, just as you formalize your ideas using mathematics.\\
**Artist Suggestions:** Mahavishnu Orchestra, Weather Report, Herbie Hancock.
