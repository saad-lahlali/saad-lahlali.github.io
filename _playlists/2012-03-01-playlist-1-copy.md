**Genre:** Post-Rock \\
**Why it fits:** This is the perfect music for staring at a whiteboard. These long songs start quiet and small, like a single fuzzy idea. Then they wander and build, ending in a huge, loud, exciting finishâ€”just like that moment you finally find the perfect research question. It's the sound of a big "I've got it!" moment.\\
**Artist Suggestions:** Explosions in the Sky, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Mogwai.
