**Genre:** Dream Pop / Shoegaze \\
**Why it fits:** This playlist is for the walk home, providing time to decompress and let your mind wander. The hazy, ethereal, and atmospheric textures of Dream Pop and Shoegaze create the perfect introspective soundscape. It's music to get lost in, allowing your thoughts to drift and connect in new, unexpected ways, creating space for those "shower thought" moments.\\
**Artist Suggestions:** Beach House, Cocteau Twins, Slowdive.
