**Genre:** Ambient \\
**Why it fits:** This music is for the long hours you have to wait for your experiments to finish. Ambient sound is like a lava lamp: it fills the silence with soft, changing sounds without ever bugging you. Itâ€™s a background hum that lets you know everything is still running, so you can relax and focus on your results.\\
**Artist Suggestions:** Brian Eno, Stars of the Lid, Aphex Twin (Selected Ambient Works).
