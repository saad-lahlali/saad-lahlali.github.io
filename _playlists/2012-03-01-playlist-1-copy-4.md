**Genre:** Funk \\
**Why it fits:** It's hard to feel like you're not good enough when this music is playing. Before you talk in front of people who seem way smarter than you, you need a big dose of confidence. Funk gives you that boost, making you want to walk up to the front with the cool, unstoppable feeling of a funky bassline.\\
**Artist Suggestions:** James Brown, Parliament-Funkadelic, Sly and the Family Stone.
