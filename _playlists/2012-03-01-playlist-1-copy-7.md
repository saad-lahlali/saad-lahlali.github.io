**Genre:** Synthwave \\
**Why it fits:** It's late, you're staring at your screen, and you're not just coding—you're the hero in an 80s movie. Synthwave has a driving, electronic beat that’s perfect for pushing through hours of work. It’s the soundtrack for beating coding errors and chugging coffee, making your work feel like a high-speed chase in a neon city.\\
**Artist Suggestions:** Kavinsky, The Midnight, Carpenter Brut.
